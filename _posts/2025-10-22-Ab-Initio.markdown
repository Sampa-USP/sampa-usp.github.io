description: The Quantum Computing Group at the SAMPA Research Group, Institute of Physics – University of São Paulo (USP) focuses on the development and application of computational methods to study quantum systems and materials. Our research explores quantum simulation techniques aimed at understanding the ground-state properties of matter, catalytic processes, and the electronic structure of complex systems. We combine quantum computing algorithms with numerical approaches such as Monte Carlo methods, variational techniques, and many-body approximations to model realistic materials with high accuracy and scalability. By bridging quantum information science and computational physics, our goal is to build new paradigms for simulating matter and advancing the predictive power of quantum technologies in materials science and chemistry.
