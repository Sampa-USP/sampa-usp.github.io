        <h3>About</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The sampa's Quantum Computing group explores the frontier of <strong>Quantum Computing</strong> as a transformative tool across
          disciplines,
          bridging <strong>quantum chemistry, materials science, and artificial intelligence</strong>.
          Our work focuses on developing <strong>quantum-enhanced computational methods</strong> capable of solving
          problems that are intractable on classical architectures.
        </p>

        <p>
          We investigate <strong>quantum algorithms</strong> for <em>electronic structure calculations</em> and
          <em>catalytic reaction modeling</em>, leveraging both <strong>variational quantum eigensolvers</strong>,
          <strong>quantum Monte Carlo techniques</strong> and <strong>Neural Networks</strong> to accurately predict
          ground-state properties and reaction pathways.
        </p>

        <p>
          By combining <strong>theoretical physics, numerical simulations, and high-performance computing</strong>,
          we aim to build a unified framework that accelerates discovery â€” from the design of efficient catalysts
          to the development of scalable quantum-inspired algorithms for the next generation of computation.
